Humpty is a flexible model for data generated by a mixture of multiple nonlinear growth components.
In the demonstration below the growth modules are logistic equations featuring growth rate and capacity parameters. 
This model enables the detection of change to the growth parameters, by detecting an increasing skewness signal in the residual, the model can identify when its time to include another component to better fit predictions going forward.   
As such the model can also be considered a change point detection for a mixture model with fixed form. 

# Quick Start 
## Building the software
The humpty tools and system is built in the Rust programming language.
To compile the code you will need to run the following in the top level directory
> cargo build --release

## constructing data
You can generate model dwith given paramters: 

> ./target/release/growth -e1.0 -i"70.,60.5,0.03,30,120,0.03" -t 400 u

## Constructring model using a csv file
The following consturcts a two hump model for data in trial.csv. 
> ./target/release/humpty -n2 -s1000 trial.csv 

## constructing images. 
The following will conduct measumrents of the top fits and render images. 
> ./target/release/measure -m out_top10_serde.ser  trial.csv
